I have high hopes for Filipino NLP.

Three years ago, I don't have any involvement in the Filipino NLP space.
It just so happened that I was the only Filipino in the spaCy team[^1], and this opened up opportunities.

[^1]: During the time I was working on spaCy, I helped build language support for multiple languages.
