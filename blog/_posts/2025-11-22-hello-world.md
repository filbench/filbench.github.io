I have high hopes for Filipino NLP.

Three years ago, I don't have any involvement in the Filipino NLP space.
It just so happened that I was the only Filipino in the [spaCy](https://spacy.io) team[^1], and despite that, there's no Tagalog language support in the library.
Perhaps it was nice to *represent*: it felt like I was alone in a grocery aisle and I spotted a cereal box on the floor. I'm already there, I'm quite capable, so why not pick it up?

[^1]: During the pre-LLM era, [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) was very useful and popular in building linguistic processing pipelines and tasks such as named-entity recognition, dependency parsing, and classification.
