date: 2024-01-15
description: Developing state-of-the-art neural machine translation models for low-resource Filipino languages, focusing on Tagalog, Cebuano, and Ilocano.
---

## Overview

This project aims to develop high-quality neural machine translation systems for Filipino languages, addressing the challenges of low-resource settings and linguistic diversity in the Philippines.

## Goals

- Build parallel corpora for major Filipino languages
- Develop transformer-based NMT models optimized for Filipino language pairs
- Create publicly available translation APIs and tools
- Establish benchmarks for Filipino language translation quality

## Current Status

We have collected over 1M parallel sentence pairs across Filipino-English language pairs and are training our first set of baseline models using multilingual transformer architectures.

## Collaborators

- University of the Philippines
- Ateneo de Manila University
