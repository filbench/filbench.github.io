[FilBench](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.127/) is the first step towards LLM evaluation on Filipino-centric tasks, but we can still do more.
Specifically:

- Increasing the breadth of languages we test upon (2 -> 6 or more). 
- Focusing only on specific tasks we care about (e.g., causal reasoning, narrative understanding, factual knowledge, etc.); and
- Evaluating on a small number of difficult and culturally-grounded examples.

In this work, we plan to create an LM benchmark by annotating specific examples from other benchmarks.

## Other links and timelines

We want to start late December and finish early 2026, just in time for the May ARR for EMNLP.
